# This is the required CRUD app made using PHP for server side scripting 
To set up this app follow the following steps:
# Make sure apache is set up in your local server and mysql is installed 
I recommend use of XAMPP application as it is bundled with all these environments
# After setting up and activating apache and mysql navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin
# create a new database with the name ongeza_test 
# Import the database file embedded in this repository named ongeza_test.sql 
# clone the other 2 files(index.php and process.php) into the directory with the following path "C:\xampp\htdocs\ongezacrudapp"
